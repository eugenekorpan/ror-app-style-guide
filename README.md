What are you thinking about seeing variable `get_UserProfile` in the code?

I think everybody remember [this story] (http://freelance.ru/img/portfolio/pics/00/04/EF/323514.jpg). It's ok for Crane to fly, it's ok for Pike to swim and Crayfish to walk on the ground but when they unite for a common goal they won't get success using only own skills.

The same with the ROR app. Image Crane, Pike and Crayfish began coding. What code would they get at the end?

Every project may have it's own code style but all developers on the project must follow same conventions.
Otherwise the variable `get_UserProfile` will be the smallest surprise along all those things you find in the code.
